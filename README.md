# autopack

**autopack** is a command-line tool that generates a reproducible install script for your Linux system based on your distribution and selected packages.

---

## Why autopack?

Installing software across different Linux distributions often means:
- Remembering which package manager to use
- Re-learning package names
- Repeating the same setup steps every time

**autopack solves this by generating a single install script tailored to your distro.**  
You pick *what* you want, autopack figures out *how* to install it.
